# Introduction
Movie Matchmaker is a group project for Washington Univeristy's Data Analytics Boot Camp. For this project, we created a web app that uses a machine learning model to recommend movies. For a short while, the app will be available online at www.movieion.com. Below is an overview and demonstration of the app.


# Technologies used:

   - IDEs (VS Code and Jupyter Notebook)
   - Web Scraping (Python-Splinter)
   - Data Wrangling (Pandas, pgAdmin)
   - Machine Learning (sklearn, scipy, and joblib)
   - Storage (PostgreSQL and S3 Bucket)
   - Backend (Python-Flask)
   - Frontend (JavaScript, Bootstrap 4, HTML5/CSS3, jQuery)
   - Web Host (AWS)
