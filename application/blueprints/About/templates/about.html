        <i>Movie Ion</i> (originally titled <i>Movie Matchmaker</i>) was a group project for
        <i>Washington University in Saint Louis'</i> Data Analytics Bootcamp (2019). For this
        project, we were tasked with creating an application that leveraged various
        skills learned throughout the course. We decided to create a web application
        that used machine learning (via Python, scikit-learn, scipy, and joblib) to recommend movies to users based on
        their preferences.
        In addition to creating a machine learning model, we also needed to create a database,
        each of which required data sources. To get the data needed, we built web scraping
        scripts (Python, beautiful soup, and splinter) to pull data from various websites. Additionally, we manually
        downloaded CSVs found online.
        Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling was then required to prepare the data for use in our system via
        Python, jupyter notebook, and PostgreSQL.
        We utilized AWS for storage (S3, RDS) and web hosting (Elastic Beanstalk, Route 53).
